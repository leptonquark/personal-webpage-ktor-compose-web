# Summary

This project is a template for a personal web application. The web application uses Kotlin Multiplatform, KTOR, and Compose for Web (experimental). 
The web application looks different on Desktop and Mobile. 

# HOWTO

The application can be run by 
```
./gradlew run
```

The web application utilizes two configuration files (Both files are in `/Users/Netlight/IntelliJProjects/me/app/src/jvmMain/resources`):

1. `main-content.json` - contains the title, about, and the contact me links. The template supports links from Github, Twitter, or LinkedIn.
2. `projects.json` - contains a list of projects. The projects can also use icons which are shown in the list view. The icon paths are stored inside this file.
